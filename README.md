### About the project
[![Build and Push Docker Image](https://github.com/nogibjj/ag825_dockerization/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/ag825_dockerization/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The aim with this project was to understand the steps required in dockerizing a python application. We do this to ensure that an appplication can run on different systems, irrespective of IDE, OS and other constraints.

This app primarily provides an interface to execute a 'Knock Knock' joke.
